# Predicting Greek Gods with Support Vector Machine

This project revolves around on making an SVM model that can predict the name of a Greek God from an image of it's statue. The project also tries to identify the parameter (C, Gamma, and Kernel) with the highest score.

The project was originally made as a final project for completion of  the 'Introduction to Artificial Intelligence' subject. (Pengantar Kecerdasan Artifisial)
